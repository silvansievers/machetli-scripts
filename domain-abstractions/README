- this dir was originaly under ~/machetli
- the .venv used whatever version of machetli one got on or briefly prior to 22.09.2022 (likely 0.7)
- the starting PDDl is parcprinter-opt11-strips:p01
- resulting small tasks from testing back then in files small-*
- probably, I started from PDDL, then translated this to SAS and tried to get the SAS even smaller
